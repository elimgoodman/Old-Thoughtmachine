For most programmers, the way we develop software is usually a combination of:

and:

We live in a world of text (and for [good reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)). Because of this text-centrism, when we make programs, we're usually typing. A lot.

But there's a whole other way of interacting with computers: clicking. It's a method of interaction that many programmers dislike a great deal; many people go to [great lengths](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) to make everything on the computer controllable by typing. 

However, I would say interfaces that are designed to be controlled by clicking can teach us a lot about how programming might be made easier. I think that by looking at the differences between clicking and typing, we can weigh the relative merits of each. Especially if you're a typing diehard (which I am), looking at the ways in which clicking excels can be really informative.

- Generative vs selective
- creates understanding vs requires understanding
- expansive interface vs finite interface
- discoverable vs latent interface
- high input vs high output
- focussed vs exploratory
