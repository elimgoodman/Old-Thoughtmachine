As computers are now, there are two main ways of interacting with them: **typing** and **clicking**. I think that examining these modes of interaction can yield some insight into making programming easier.

## Generation and Selection

Fundamentally, the big difference between the two is that typing is **generative**, which clicking is **selective**. You've got to have a lot of pre-existing knowledge in your head to type. Even if you're just writing English prose, for example, you have to know the rules of the language, the spellings of words, and so on. On the other hand, clicking doesn't require a lot of understanding. In fact, maybe it would accurate to say that typing *requires* understanding, while clicking *generates* understanding. By clicking around in a given environment, you can figure out what different things do.

What seems interesting to me is that more or less every programming environment in use today is predominantly typing-oriented. For most working programmers, it's usually a combination of:

and:

I'm not critiquing this fact - it makes a lot of sense. Most programmers have already done the hard work of accumulating the understanding necessary to use typing as their primary means of interacting with the computer. Additionally, it seems like typing is a much more efficient way of getting information into the computer. Lastly, typing fascilitates much "bigger" interfaces - the number of commands that one could type at the command line, for example, is much bigger than could ever be expressed as point-and-click options.

## Why click at all?

Typing is already pretty predominant in programming tools, so let's now explore the benefits of clicking. 

### Discoverable and Latent Interfaces

Clicking facilitates **discoverable** interfaces, while typing fasciltates **latent** interfaces. Each interface type has its place. Discoverable interfaces give the user information ahead of time, while latent interfaces give feedback once the user has done something.

- Discoverable vs latent
- Input vs output
- Focussed vs exploratory
