In my [previous post](http://thoughtmachine.co/what-makes-programming-hard-pt-1/), I started talking about what makes programming so dang hard to begin with. I'd like to continue in this vein.

###Problem #2: Programming forces people to learn a number of lot of concepts that don't fit together all that well.

When I'm programming, I have to keep a fuckload of different concepts in my head - concepts from the language, the libraries I'm using, and my own codebase. Let's call all of these things (language features, libraries, and objects/functions in my project's codebase) *programming entities*. The way I understand things is to build a mental model of the entity, and then query that model for information. However, in order to store a meaningful model in my head, the entity actually has to be pretty simple, and not have that many exceptions, or even rules. Simple things are easier to understand. In order to be simple enough to make into a meaningful mental model, the thing being modeled has to be well designed. *Design* is the crucial element that makes things modelable.
